    <h3>DAY - 1 Assignment  Q2:</h3>
    <p>2. write the diffrence between var, let and cosnt  with code example ?</p>
            
                <h4>var</h4>
            <p>    
                var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
                var variables can be re-declared and updated
This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an error.</p>
                <pre>
                    example:
                    var greeter = "hey hi";
                    var greeter = "say Hello instead";
                </pre>
            <h4>Let</h4>
            <p>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's  comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves Some problem with var. 
                Let is block a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.
                So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. let can be updated but not re-declared.
            </p>
            <pre>
                EXAMPLE:
                {
                    let greeting = "say Hi";
                }
            </pre>
            <h4>const</h4>
            <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.const declarations are block scoped
                Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.const declarations are block scoped
                Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
                const cannot be updated or re-declared.
                This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. 
                Even if we try to re- declaration then error will be shown</p>
                <pre>
                    EXAMPLE:
                    const greeting = "say Hi";
                    greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Assignment to constant variable.
                </pre>
<script>
        // variable example
         var greeter = "hey hi";
         var greeter = "say Hello instead";

        //let example
        {
            let greeting = "say Hi";
        }
        //cosnt example
        const greeting = "say Hi";
         greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.
</script>
