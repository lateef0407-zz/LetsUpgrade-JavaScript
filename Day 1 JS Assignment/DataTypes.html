    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <p>"Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.<br>
<br>
    There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: <br>

    1. Primitive (or primary),<br> 
    2. Composite (or reference), <br>
    3. Special data types. <br><br>
    
    1. Primitive (or primary):<br>
    String, Number, and Boolean are called as primitive data types. <br><br>
    
    2. Composite (or reference):<br>
    Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. <br><br>

    3. Special data types:<br>
   Undefined and Null are special data types.<br><br>
    
    Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold multiple values and more complex entities."</p>
